# generative-infracgi
Demos for a generative version of the InfraCGI project

## Contents

* A [notebook runnable on Colab](Generative_InfraCGI.ipynb), using Huggingface models to remove roads, vehicles and street furniture from images and replace it with imaginary infrastructure. Works on any web-based street view image

## Contributing

I would love any contributions, whether interfaces to make it more accessible, improvements to prompts, or comedy value applications
