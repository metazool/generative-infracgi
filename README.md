## Contents

* A simple [notebook runnable on Colab](Generative_InfraCGI.ipynb), showing use of Huggingface models to remove roads, vehicles and street furniture from images and replace it with imaginary infrastructure. Works on any web-based street view image

I would love any contributions, whether interfaces to make it more accessible, improvements to prompts, or comedy value applications
